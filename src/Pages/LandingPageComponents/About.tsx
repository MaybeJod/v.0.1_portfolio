						<p>(ABOUT ME)</p>
						<p>
							Hi! I'm Jod â€” a Designer, a Developer, and a professional
							certified expert at Winging It. I combine clean design, solid
							code, and a sprinkle of chaos to bring ideas to life.
						</p>
						<p>
							Every great project starts with a solid idea, a bit of Googling,
							and just enough overconfidence to keep things interesting. Let's
							build something amazing together!
						</p>
						<p>
							When I'm not immersed in development and design, you can find me
							playing badminton, eating banger food or tending to my cherished
							houseplants
						</p>
